        <h2>Projects</h2>
                <h3>Accidental Database</h3>
                <p>When i was 14 i was making a discord bot, which would have a playing game feature.
                    There to store the data (I did not know about databases back then), I used json files.
                    I implemented the CRUD operations on it from scratch. did not know back then what i was building.
                    But Surely it certifies as a database.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Mobile SMS Bomber</h3>
                <p>There was this salesman who called me everytime, to teach him a lesson
                    i built a SMS Bomber which simply registered to many websites with a 
                    burner email and put the mobile number of the "victim" in the respective 
                    section. Time spent well.
                </p>

                <h3>Hinduism</h3>
                <p>Made proper Bots and Scripts to promote Hinduism among those who needed it.
                    spreading the shuddha hindi movement through entire India, which has 
                    been seen to used by Notable legends like J. Sai Deepak.
                </p>

                <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
                <p>implemented my personal neural netowrk in python using numpy only.</p>

                <h3>Markov Chain</h3>
                <p>Implemented a very simple "Language Model" using the Markov Chain technique,
                    also known as the Bigram Model, which is a fundamental step for being introduced
                    to Transformers and LLM.
                </p>

                <h3>Sodium</h3>
                <p>Built a basic compiler for my own language which would compile to Assembly.
                    tried making a allocator but did not know the concepts of Computer Architecture back then.
                    Too busy to touch the project now.
                </p>

                <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>If i see a dataset, a model will learn it.</p>

                <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
                <p>Understood Autograd, my favourite tool developed by humanity. And then Understood micrograd. Then i build nanograd XD.</p>

                <h3>CST Studio Pipeline</h3>
                <p>Developed a pipeline to convert ASCII file exported from CST Studio
                    into proper tabular dataset which would obviously be machine learned. Accidently Increased
                    the performance of the project where it was used by 25200 times.
                
                    Made a v2 of the same with more increased performance.
                </p>

                <h3>CST Studio Plotter</h3>
                <p>Why plot in origin when you can code?</p>

                <h3>Game of life</h3>
                <p>Simulated the game of life in JS.</p>

                <h3>Color scheme generator</h3>
                <p>Upload an image to extract its dominant colours, so that you can rice your arch in peace.</p>

                <h3>LSTMs</h3>
                <p>Unloaded the power of LSTMs on time series data.</p>

                <h3>Neural Nets</h3>
                <p>FASCINATED BY NEURAL NETS I ASCEND THE KINGDOM OF GOD TO TRAIN HIS DATA ON A CUSTOM MODEL.</p>
                
                <h3>lolfetch</h3>
                <p>A simple system information tool written in C</p>

                <h3>sell shell</h3>
                <p>taught a beginner what actually is a shell, by making a shell</p>

                <h3>atoi</h3>
                <p>showed a begginer that atoi function in C is not magic. it is C itself.</p>
